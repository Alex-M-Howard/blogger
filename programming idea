Blog Application

A blog application is an excellent choice for beginners because it covers essential aspects of Django, like working with models, views, templates, and handling user input. It also provides you with the opportunity to learn about authentication and authorization if you want to implement user-specific features.

The blog application should include the following features:

List of blog posts: Display a list of blog posts on the home page with titles, short descriptions, and publication dates.

Blog post details: When users click on a blog post title, they should be taken to a separate page that displays the full post, including the title, content, author, and publication date.

Add new post: Implement a form for adding new blog posts. This form should be accessible only to authenticated users (if you decide to implement authentication).

Edit and delete posts: Allow the author of the post (or an admin) to edit or delete a blog post. Again, this should only be accessible to authenticated users.

(Optional) User authentication: Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality using Django's built-in authentication system. You can also display the author's name on each blog post and allow only the author or admin users to edit or delete the post.

(Optional) Comments: Allow users to leave comments on blog posts. You can also implement nested comments (i.e., replies to other comments) for a more advanced feature.

As you progress through building this blog application, you'll learn and practice the core concepts of Django, such as working with models, views, templates, URLs, and forms. Once you feel comfortable with these concepts, you can start exploring more advanced topics, like handling file uploads, using Django's class-based views, or working with Django REST Framework for building APIs.
